# C# JSON Serialization Libraries Comparison

This repository aims to compare the performance of popular JSON serialization libraries in the C# ecosystem. I evaluate each library's serialization and deserialization capabilities, providing insights and recommendations based on my findings.

## Performance Metrics

I conduct performance tests to measure both the serialization and deserialization speeds, as well as memory usage, of each library under various scenarios and data volumes.

- **Serialization Performance**: Comparison of serialization times and memory consumption across libraries.
- **Deserialization Performance**: Evaluation of deserialization speeds and memory footprint.

## Findings

### Serialization

- **System.Text.Json**: [Results]
- **NewtonsoftJson**: [Results]
- **Utf8Json**: [Results]
- **SpanJson**: [Results]

### Deserialization

- **System.Text.Json**: [Results]
- **NewtonsoftJson**: [Results]
- **Utf8Json**: [Results]
- **SpanJson**: [Results]
  
## Insights & Recommendations

Based on my performance analysis, I provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each library and offer recommendations for different use cases.
